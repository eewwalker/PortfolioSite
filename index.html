<!-- //Some kind of navigation (a navbar at the top, for example). In a multi-page site, this should link to the other pages;

//At least three pages or sections:
Landing area/top area with a photo
About you (including a PDF of your most current resume)
Contact information

//Styling. You can either do this by writing CSS yourself or by using a CSS framework, like Bootstrap. You donâ€™t need to
have a complex or extremely-polished visual design, but you do need to make things look a bit stylized. -->

      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <h4>Horticulturalist turned Software Engineer</h4>
      <p>For the past 6 years I have been working as a gardener in the Bay Area. I was introduced to software
        engineering through an old friend and took a quick interest in it.
        For the past year, I have been studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript , learning fundamentals and building
        projects through courses and on my own.
        I enjoyed being outside and working in nature but needed a new challenge. This career change I know will
        continue to be one in
        which I feel stimulated,
        enjoying the problem solving and continuous learning software engineering has to offer. I am passionate about
        bringing inclusivity and accessibilty to this industry.

      </p>
