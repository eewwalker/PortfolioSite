<!-- //Some kind of navigation (a navbar at the top, for example). In a multi-page site, this should link to the other pages;
on a single-page site, this should take the user to the different headings.

//At least three pages or sections:
Landing area/top area with a photo
About you (including a PDF of your most current resume)
Contact information

//Styling. You can either do this by writing CSS yourself or by using a CSS framework, like Bootstrap. You donâ€™t need to
have a complex or extremely-polished visual design, but you do need to make things look a bit stylized. -->

      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <h4>Horticulturalist turned Software Engineer</h4>
      <p>For the past 6 years I have been working as a gardener in the Bay Area. I was introduced to software
        engineering through a old friend and took a quick interest in it.
        For the past year, I have been studying HTML, CSS and JS in my spare time. Learning fundamentals and building
        projects through courses and on my own.
        I enjoyed being outside and working in nature but felt I was missing being challenged, I want a career in which
        I continue to learn and feel stimulated.
        I enjoy the problem solving and continuous learning software engineering has to offer.
